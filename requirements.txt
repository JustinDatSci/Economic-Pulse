# Economic Pulse V3.0 - Multi-Asset Financial Intelligence Platform
# Enhanced requirements with optional advanced ML libraries

# Core Streamlit and Data Libraries (Required)
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0
plotly>=5.17.0
requests>=2.28.0

# Basic ML Libraries (Required for core functionality)
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
scipy>=1.10.0

# Enhanced Data Sources (Optional but recommended)
yfinance>=0.2.0
# ccxt>=4.0.0  # Commented out - may cause issues in some environments

# Advanced ML Libraries (Optional - will gracefully fallback if not available)
# tensorflow>=2.10.0  # Commented out for Streamlit Cloud compatibility
# keras>=2.10.0       # Included with tensorflow

# Time Series Analysis
# statsmodels>=0.14.0  # Optional for advanced time series analysis

# Additional Utilities
python-dateutil>=2.8.0
pytz>=2023.3

# Data Validation and Processing
# pydantic>=2.0.0     # Optional for data validation

# Caching and Performance
# redis>=4.5.0        # Optional for advanced caching
# joblib>=1.3.0       # Optional for model persistence

# Development and Testing (Optional)
# pytest>=7.4.0       # For testing
# black>=23.0.0       # For code formatting
# flake8>=6.0.0       # For linting

# Note: Some advanced libraries are commented out to ensure compatibility
# with Streamlit Cloud. The app will automatically detect available libraries
# and enable features accordingly.

# Fallback libraries (automatically handled by the app):
# - If tensorflow is not available: Uses scikit-learn models only
# - If yfinance is not available: Uses simulated financial data
# - If ccxt is not available: Uses simulated crypto data

# For local development with full features, uncomment:
# tensorflow>=2.10.0
# ccxt>=4.0.0
# statsmodels>=0.14.0
